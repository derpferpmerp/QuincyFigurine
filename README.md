# The Quincy NFT Profit Calculator!

This program is capable of telling the profit from selling and buying<br>
Quincy's NFT at different rounds in the game. I programmed this once<br>
I saw that there was some difficulties over at the bloons fandom page<br>
to create the calculator in question...<br>
<br>
In order to improve the UX, I compiled it into a GUI (using PySimpleGUI)<br>
and to further improve the ux, compressed it into two executables (one for<br>
linux, and one for Windows)<br>

Here's what the GUI Program Looks Like (As of 0.0.0):<br><br>

Hope this makes it onto the Official Wiki!!!
